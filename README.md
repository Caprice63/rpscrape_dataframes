# rpscrape
This code has been duplicated from https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape
The aim is to amend the code so that it created a dataframe of the results/racecards that can be easily saved to xls / csv files.

I'm learning python as I go so please feel free to modify the file with your suggestions.  I'm also new to Github so bear with me as I learn.
